- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ciuvaskibiras A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. These bonds are formed by the sharing or exchange of electrons among atoms. Molecules can be incredibly simple, like diatomic hydrogen (H‚ÇÇ), or extremely complex, like proteins and DNA.

Types of Molecules
Diatomic Molecules: These consist of only two atoms, which can be either the same element (homonuclear) or different elements (heteronuclear). For example, O‚ÇÇ (oxygen) is homonuclear, while HCl (hydrochloric acid) is heteronuclear.
Polyatomic Molecules: These consist of more than two atoms. Examples include water (H‚ÇÇO) and glucose (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ).
Macromolecules: These are very large molecules, often composed of thousands of atoms. Examples include proteins and DNA.
Chemical Bonds
Covalent Bonds: Atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of electrons. Covalent bonds can be nonpolar (equal sharing of electrons) or polar (unequal sharing of electrons).
Ionic Bonds: Atoms transfer electrons from one to another, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions that attract each other.
